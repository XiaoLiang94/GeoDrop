# Description
This is a user-friendly video processing code for quickly extracting the time-varying geometric features of generating droplets, including the droplet curvature radius, droplet volume, and surface area.

# Python package version 

Tkinter version: 8.6 <br>
NumPy version: 1.22.4 <br>
PIL version: 9.2.0 <br>
cv2 version: 4.7.0 <br>

# Details
### Folders
**main**: Code of the project <br>
**Demo**: A showcase for demonstratating how to use this software <br>

### User Instructions
The user interface of the software is divided into four parts: (1) Analysis operation, including options for reading and analyzing video. (2) Parameter adjustment for changing the Pixels/Length ratio and modifying threshold. (3) Real-time display windows to display the ongoing video processing. (4) Result display and save them.

1. Set the Pixels/Length ratio and threshold value.
2. Press the "Read video" buttom to load the video. 
3. Press the "Analyze video" buttom.
4. Select the backgraound image from the video or from the local path.
5. Select the ROI (Region of Interest). Use the mouse to click on the image to set the top-left and bottom-right points of the ROI rectangle. Press the "Review" buttom to check the ROI.
6. Press the "Select" buttom to start processing.
7. Check the results and save them.
